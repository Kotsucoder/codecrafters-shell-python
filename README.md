# Custom Shell Implementation

A POSIX-compliant shell implementation built in Python as part of the [CodeCrafters "Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview). This learning project demonstrates core systems programming concepts by implementing a functional command-line shell from scratch.

## Overview

This project implements a custom shell interpreter capable of:
- Parsing and executing shell commands
- Running external programs
- Supporting builtin commands (exit, echo, type)
- Handling user input in a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment
- Processing command-line arguments

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Systems Programming**: Understanding of shell internals and process management
- **Command Parsing**: Tokenization and interpretation of shell commands
- **REPL Design**: Interactive command-line interface implementation
- **Python Development**: Object-oriented design and error handling
- **POSIX Compliance**: Adherence to shell standards and conventions

## Project Structure

- `app/main.py` - Main shell implementation with builtin command handlers
- `your_program.sh` - Entry point script for running the shell

## Running the Shell

1. Ensure you have `uv` installed locally
2. Run `./your_program.sh` to start the shell
3. The shell will display a `$` prompt and accept commands

## About CodeCrafters

This project was completed as part of the CodeCrafters learning platform, which provides hands-on challenges for building real-world systems from scratch. The challenge focuses on understanding how shells work at a fundamental level, covering topics like command parsing, REPLs, builtin commands, and process execution.
